#Using a RegEx Function to Count the # of Sequences in a FASTA File

FASTA is a text-based format for representing nucleotide or amino acid sequences using single-letter code: Adenine = A, Thymine = T, C = Cytosine. A popular, free tool for comparing FASTA sequences is NIH's BLAST: https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi

BLAST's algorithm is written in C and C++, but regular expressions in Python can perform a lot of the same functions as BLAST such as counting k-mers, calculating sequence alignment, etc. This is an example of a function I wrote for class that counts the number of sequences in a FASTA file by matching the number of single-line descriptors (">"):

```{python}
file_handle = open("ls_orchid.fasta", "r") # open in 'r' mode  to read the file
contents = file_handle.read() # reads the entire file 
file_handle.close() # always close at the end

from pprint import pprint



def count_seq(fname):
    count = 0
    with open(fname, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            if line.startswith(">"):
                count += 1
    print("Total number of sequences is:", count)

fname = "ls_orchid.fasta"
count_seq(fname)
```
